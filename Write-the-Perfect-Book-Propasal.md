## Chapter 2 - Choosing the Title

### Choosing a good title

Reasons to choose a good title:

1. A good title will *attract* interest of a potential publisher or agent.
2. It is difficult to choose a good title, so it will force you to really focus on the core message of your book, thus causing you to thoroughly plan your perfect book proposal.
3. Your great title becomes the trunk of the tree of a book proposal that you are growing. Every time you veer off your path, you will envision your tree with the title you have carefully selected, and it will lead you safely back to center.
4. Having a good title will get your foot in the door, and the rest of the proposal will make sure you are invited inside for a cup of tea.

Bad title: *Whose turn is it to push the Volkswagen?*

### Selecting a good title

#### What do you know about titles

1. They are clear.

3. Sacrifice the "jazzy" factor for blandness if it means clarity.
4. Balance bland clarity with an effort to be clever.

Balance what reader needs with what they want. Spend extra energy on getting a good title. Don't rush this part. Make this part of the good things you are doing for yourself to increase the possibility of a successful sale.

## Chapter 4 - How Are Proposals Structured?

- book proposal is a tool of the trade for nonfiction authors
- need to conform to this publishing protocol
- a nonfiction book has to have strong content to be seriously considered by publishers and literary agents
- like a business plan that entices the potential investor (i.e., the publisher) to part with their cash
- begin with an "Overview" section and end with the "Chapter Outline" or "Sample Chapter(s)"

### Section 1: The Overview

1. The overview needs to be an abundantly clear and precise statement about your **vision** for the book.
2. Agents and editors should be able to easily and quickly understand what your proposed work will be about on the basis of your overview.
3. Imagine you have only 30 seconds to describe your book, so condense your description down to its most revealing and magnetic aspects.
4. The overview serves as a seductive invitation to read the entire proposal.
5. Make the overview short and sweet.

### Section 2: About the Author

- think laudatory press release
  - impressive facts about your professional and personal credentials
  - achievements
  - experiences
  - education
  - special honors
  - etc.

- You need to introduce yourself to publishers as a neo-celebrity within the specific tribes relevant to your proposed book.

- with a busy and noisy internet, how are you going to get attention?
- Revenue precedes quality, author platform precedes content. Period!

- Publishers need to leverage the author's marketing infrastructure, resources, and skills for the purpose of selling copies.
  - Publishers provide many benefits, but selling and marketing tend to be their most anemic skill-set.
- Bottom Line
  1. Publishers need the author to provide all content.
  2. Publishers need the author to  ring the resources (platform) upon which the marketing will happen.

- Platform metrics
  - social media networks
  - media visibility
  - speaking events
  - public appearances
  - What happens when your name is googled?

- You don't have to be famous, but you need to be a recognized "brand" within the communities of potential customers relevant to your book's subject.

- "Instant" Platforms
  - true crime
  - newsworthy narratives and memoirs
  - old-fashioned fascinating stories that people want to talk about with each other
- if your book falls into this category show how it will create a spontaneous platform

- without a platform, consider building a platform before pitching or self-publishing your book
  - read a book about how to build a platform

### Section 4: Author Marketing Plan

- how will you promote the book?
- sequenced list of action points
  1. send compelling alerts to qualified list of 50,000 email subscribers/customers
  2. leverage influence with important bloggers
