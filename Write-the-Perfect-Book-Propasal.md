## Chapter 2 - Choosing the Title

### Choosing a good title

Reasons to choose a good title:

1. A good title will *attract* interest of a potential publisher or agent.
2. It is difficult to choose a good title, so it will force you to really focus on the core message of your book, thus causing you to thoroughly plan your perfect book proposal.
3. Your great title becomes the trunk of the tree of a book proposal that you are growing. Every time you veer off your path, you will envision your tree with the title you have carefully selected, and it will lead you safely back to center.
4. Having a good title will get your foot in the door, and the rest of the proposal will make sure you are invited inside for a cup of tea.

Bad title: *Whose turn is it to push the Volkswagen?*

- well-thought out commercial self-help business book
- author had superb credentials
- powerful self-marketing resources

### Selecting a good title

- do no harm, take titles seriously
- how does it make the reader feel
- choose a title that intrigues without confusion
- make it easy on your potential benefactor
  - use the title as a fishing lure
- readers choose a book that conveys clearly what is in it for them.
- WIIFM factor must be clear, your title is the first opportunity to convey this

#### What do you know about titles

1. They are clear.
2. They make it clear what the book is about.
3. Sacrifice the "jazzy" factor for blandness if it means clarity.
4. Balance bland clarity with an effort to be clever.

Balance what reader needs with what they want. Spend extra energy on getting a good title. Don't rush this part. Make this part of the good things you are doing for yourself to increase the possibility of a successful sale.
